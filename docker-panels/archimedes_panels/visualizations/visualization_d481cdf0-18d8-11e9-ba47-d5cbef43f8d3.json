Ideal case would be low values for both, which means contributors are attended soon and tickets are closed in a reasonable time. Worst case would be having long bars for both, which means customers have to wait a long time to get our first attention and also closing time is of course longer than desired.\\n\\n**Trends** in bar chart give an idea about where are we going to.\\n\\n**Gauges** show times in average and median to complement bar chart with a more general view.\\n\\n[See complete panel documentation](https://bitergia.gitlab.io/panel-collections/open_source_program_office/efficiency-timing-overview.html)\"},\"aggs\":[]}"
